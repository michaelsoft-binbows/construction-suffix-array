# construction-suffix-array
As part as of my minor in uni, I developed an efficient string algorithm that creates and sorts a suffix array of huge, multiple concatenated strings. Such efficient algorithm is important in Bioinformatics to speed up the process DNA sequencing. I implemented it in C++ for good performance.
